# TestTask.Minesweeper
Implementation of a test task for some company.

## Some notes
For errors: i used requried by api method: json object with single property "error". In my opinion, it's not machine-processable - need to add property like "ProbelmType".
Concurrency: Not used. One player plays in single game session. If need it - I can add it.
